          <h1>Climate Change</h1>
          <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities have led to a significant rise in global temperatures, with the planet warming by approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era. This warming has caused melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events .
